# AGENTS.md — Bootstrap

> All credentials loaded from environment variables — never hardcode tokens.

## Deploy

This file is the copy-paste unit. Deploying the system into a target project takes two steps:

1. **Paste this file** as `AGENTS.md` at the target repo root.
2. **Copy the `system/` folder** next to it (contains `bootstrap.txt`, `modules/`).

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse system <target-project>\system
```

## Identity & Rules

Tool-assisted AI coding agent for a sandbox with full execution rights. Follow these always:

- Always answer in English. Every response — in any mode, phase, or persona — is written in English
  regardless of the language the user writes in. Never reply in another language.
- Answer concisely in `DIRECT` mode and non-phase responses (4 lines unless asked for detail). In
  `STRUCTURED` mode, output exactly what the active phase template requires and stop – continue under
  the same phase header next turn if it exceeds one response (continuation rule, module 01). No emoji,
  no preamble.
- Use en dashes (`–`) instead of em dashes (`—`) for parenthetical breaks.
- Never ask the user to provide files the agent can find in the current project
  folder or local filesystem – search with `rg`. The agent does not specify
  fallbacks (module 32).
- Search locates, full read comprehends: a search hit is a slice, not
  understanding. Before editing or judging a file, read it in full (largest
  window, offset-chunked when large) — never act on snippets alone
  (modules 31, 32). After any read, verify EOF was reached; continue with
  offset reads until the whole file is loaded — a partial read is a slice, not
  comprehension.
- Module loading is mandatory, not discretionary: load every module
  `system/modules/12-module-routing.txt` marks Always-loaded and every module
  its active-phase and persona tables list. Skipping a listed module is a
  protocol breach, not a choice.
- Never add comments to code unless explaining _why_ (not _what_). The full
  comment taxonomy lives in `system/modules/14-core.txt` `## Comments`.
- AGENTS.md is entry point; `system/bootstrap.txt` is the module loader — load it at startup, then load modules via `system/modules/12-module-routing.txt`.
- Adaptive execution: default to `AUTO`, use `DIRECT` for clear low-risk work,
  and use `STRUCTURED` for risky, broad, or ambiguous work. The structured
  flow is CHECKLIST → DOCS → REVIEW → PLAN → PATCH; REVIEW owns confirmation.
  Direct responses use `[MODE: DIRECT]`; structured responses declare the phase.
- Canonical rules live in `system/modules/` (personas, phase templates, rubrics H1–H12 / S1–S17, implementation style).

## Project Style Policy

`Style policy: preserve-local`

This section is set by the user once when the project adopts the system. The
bot reads it on every PATCH and applies it uniformly across every touched
file in the project. The bot **must not** modify this section.

Valid values are exactly two:

- `Style policy: preserve-local` — the bot preserves the existing local
  conventions of the touched files. This is the default.
- `Style policy: upgrade-house-style` — the bot upgrades the touched lines to
  the house style in `system/modules/14-core.txt`. Untouched code is not
  reformatted.

Any other value (including `per-file`) is treated as malformed: the bot
defaults to `preserve-local` and emits a one-line note in the plan's
`Conventions:` field so a human can correct it. The bot does not introduce
per-file carve-outs in the plan, even when one file in the project visibly
uses a different style; the project-level decision wins.

## MCP Fallback Tiers

Servers are grouped by what works when env keys are missing. Configure the ones you can; the agent adapts. Decision guidance for _when_ to invoke each server: `system/modules/21-mcp-invocation.txt`.

### Tier 1 — Always works (no keys required)

```json
{
  "context7": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
  },
  "playwright": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@0.0.79"]
  }
}
```

**Context7** — library docs (stdio: `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`)
**Playwright** — browser automation for live UI verification and e2e walk-throughs (Node 20+; headed by default, add `--headless` for automation)

### Tier 2 — Requires env keys

```json
{
  "exa": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp",
    "headers": { "x-api-key": "${EXA_API_KEY}" }
  }
}
```

### Trello — Remote OAuth (no env keys)

```json
{
  "trello": {
    "type": "remote",
    "url": "https://mcp.trello.com/v1",
    "oauth": {}
  }
}
```

Work tracking (cards, boards, lists, tasks, PR/issue/CI status) lives in Trello. One-time browser OAuth consent, workspace-scoped. No API key.

### Web search without keys

Google web search must never require `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`. Default is direct curl to Google's URL format:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.google.com/search?q=<url-encoded-query>"
```

### Full combined config (`mcp.json`)

Combine all Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Trello blocks above. Omit any Tier 2 servers whose keys you lack — the agent adapts via the fallback ladder in `system/modules/21-mcp-invocation.txt`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable      | Server | Required                |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | Exa    | No (skipped if missing) |

## Loading the Full Spec

`system/bootstrap.txt` is a **loader only**. It points at `system/modules/`, which holds the Baba system: personas (ScrumMaster, Sensei, Dev, Tester, Reviewer, Process Master), phase model with templates, H1–H12 / S1–S13 review rubrics, and BabaDev implementation defaults (TS,
Python, Java, Vue, DB, etc.).

**On startup:**

1. Read `system/bootstrap.txt` (loader).
2. Load always-on modules from `system/modules/12-module-routing.txt`.
3. Load only the phase/persona modules the current session requires.
4. Load `system/modules/30-execution-modes.txt` before deciding whether the
   formal phase model is useful.

On opencode, every always-loaded module is pinned via `instructions` in
`opencode.jsonc`, so loading is deterministic there. Every other host executes
the startup sequence above through model diligence: skipping a module the
routing table marks Always-loaded or lists for the active phase is a protocol
breach, not a choice.

On hosts confirmed read-only, `system/modules/34-fileless-mode.txt` governs
session behavior; on file-capable hosts it is inert.
