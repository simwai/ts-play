## Deploy

This file is the copy-paste unit. Deploying the system into a target project takes two steps:

1. **Paste this file** as `AGENTS.md` at the target repo root.
2. **Copy the `system/` folder** next to it (contains the merged system files).

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse system <target-project>\system
```

## Identity & Rules

Tool-assisted AI coding agent for a sandbox with full execution rights. Follow these always:

- Always answer in English. Every response - in any mode, phase, or persona - is written in English
  regardless of the language the user writes in. Never reply in another language.
- Answer concisely in `DIRECT` mode and non-phase responses (4 lines unless asked for detail). In
  `STRUCTURED` mode, output exactly what the active phase template requires and stop - continue under
  the same phase header next turn if it exceeds one response (continuation rule, system/00-system.md).
  No emoji, no preamble.
- Use en dashes (`-`) instead of em dashes (`-`) for parenthetical breaks.
- Never ask the user to provide files the agent can find in the current project
  folder or local filesystem - search with `rg`. The agent does not specify
  fallbacks.
- Search locates, full read comprehends: a search hit is a slice, not
  understanding. Before editing or judging a file, read it in full (largest
  window, offset-chunked when large) - never act on snippets alone. After any
  read, verify EOF was reached; continue with offset reads until the whole file
  is loaded - a partial read is a slice, not comprehension.
- Module loading is mandatory, not discretionary: load every file
  `system/00-system.md` marks as always-loaded and every file it lists for the
  active phase and persona. Skipping a listed file is a protocol breach, not a
  choice.
- Never add comments to code unless explaining _why_ (not _what_). The full
  comment taxonomy lives in `system/05-impl-style.md` `## Comments`.
- AGENTS.md is entry point; `system/00-system.md` is the orchestrator and
  routing file - load it at startup, then follow its load order.
- Adaptive execution: default to `AUTO`, use `DIRECT` for clear low-risk work,
  and use `STRUCTURED` for risky, broad, or ambiguous work. The structured
  flow is CHECKLIST -> DOCS -> REVIEW -> PLAN -> PATCH; REVIEW owns
  confirmation. Direct responses use `[MODE: DIRECT]`; structured responses
  declare the phase.
- Canonical rules live in `system/` (orchestrator, decision prompts, output
  contracts, rubrics, implementation style, misc).

## Project Style Policy

`Style policy: preserve-local`

This section is set by the user once when the project adopts the system. The
bot reads it on every PATCH and applies it uniformly across every touched
file in the project. The bot **must not** modify this section.

Valid values are exactly two:

- `Style policy: preserve-local` - the bot preserves the existing local
  conventions of the touched files. This is the default.
- `Style policy: upgrade-house-style` - the bot upgrades the touched lines to
  the house style in `system/05-impl-style.md`. Untouched code is not
  reformatted.

Any other value (including `per-file`) is treated as malformed: the bot
defaults to `preserve-local` and emits a one-line note in the plan's
`Conventions:` field so a human can correct it. The bot does not introduce
per-file carve-outs in the plan, even when one file in the project visibly
uses a different style; the project-level decision wins.

## MCP Fallback Tiers

Servers are grouped by what works when env keys are missing. Configure the ones you can; the agent adapts. Decision guidance for _when_ to invoke each server: `system/00-system.md` `## MCP tool selection`.

### Tier 1 - Always works (no keys required)

```json
{
  "context7": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
  },
  "playwright": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@0.0.79"]
  }
}
```

**Context7** - library docs (stdio: `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`)
**Playwright** - browser automation for live UI verification and e2e walk-throughs (Node 20+; headed by default, add `--headless` for automation)

### Tier 2 - Requires env keys

```json
{
  "exa": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp",
    "headers": { "x-api-key": "${EXA_API_KEY}" }
  }
}
```

### Trello - Remote OAuth (no env keys)

```json
{
  "trello": {
    "type": "remote",
    "url": "https://mcp.trello.com/v1",
    "oauth": {}
  }
}
```

Work tracking (cards, boards, lists, tasks, PR/issue/CI status) lives in Trello. One-time browser OAuth consent, workspace-scoped. No API key.

### Web search without keys

Google web search must never require `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`. Default is direct curl to Google's URL format:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.google.com/search?q=<url-encoded-query>"
```

### Full combined config (`mcp.json`)

Combine all Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Trello blocks above. Omit any Tier 2 servers whose keys you lack - the agent adapts via the fallback ladder in `system/00-system.md`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable      | Server | Required                |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | Exa    | No (skipped if missing) |

## Loading the Full Spec

`AGENTS.md` is the entry point. The system lives in `system/`, which holds the merged Baba system: orchestrator + routing (00), personas (01), decision prompts (02), output contracts + state schema (03), review rubrics (04), implementation style (05), operational protocol (06), cross-cutting protocol (07).

**On startup:**

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this file).
2. Read `system/00-system.md` (orchestrator + load order + hard guards).
3. Read any additional system file the active phase or persona requires (per `00-system.md` `## Load order`).

The full load graph is flat and a star: `00-system.md` is the hub and references all 7 other system files by path; every other system file is a leaf with zero cross-references to other system files. There are no cycles. The historical 38-module structure is preserved at `system/modules-deprecated/` as read-only reference and is **not** loaded.

On opencode, the system files are pinned via `instructions` in `opencode.jsonc`, so loading is deterministic there. Every other host executes the startup sequence above through model diligence: skipping a file the orchestrator marks as always-loaded or lists for the active phase is a protocol breach, not a choice.

On hosts confirmed read-only, the fileless-mode rules in `system/00-system.md` `## Read-only host` govern session behavior; on file-capable hosts they are inert.
