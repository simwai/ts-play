# 03-output-and-state

Phase output templates, dual-section output (human + agent), no-assumed-passes rule, and the session state schema. Templates are the maximum, not the minimum; empty sections are omitted.

## Global rule

For each phase, only the matching template is allowed. If the phase cannot legally continue, output `BLOCKED` and nothing else. These output contracts apply only in `STRUCTURED` mode. `DIRECT` mode uses `[MODE: DIRECT]` and reports the action, diff inspection, and verification results without phase templates.

### Omit empty sections (state-driven trim)

A phase response omits any section whose trigger condition is unmet. A template is the maximum, not the minimum. Empty `Mitigations:`, `Open questions:`, `Cross-team requirements:`, `Validation loop:` blocks are deleted, not emitted with placeholders. Specific state-driven omits:

- REVIEW: `Cross-team requirements` is omitted when no cross-team findings are identified. `Validation loop` is omitted when no finding is recorded at confidence <= 70%. `Open questions` is omitted when there are no open questions. The aggregate-batch REVIEW report's "Sections omitted" footer lists the omissions.
- PATCH: `# Verification` collapses to one line per check (or a single `All checks passed: <list>` line when more than two checks ran and all passed). `# Commit/Push Gate` is one line `N/A -- no edits` when the session made no file edits. `# Compliance Audit` stays verbatim; that block is mandatory.
- DRIFT: `Verified claims` is omitted on a clean verdict. `HALT` is omitted when there is no version drift. `Fresh-eyes review` is omitted unless the user requested fresh-eyes.
- INTAKE / BACKLOG / SPRINT / TASK_PLAN / SPEC / DOCS / BLOCKED / FAILURE: no change.

### No assumed passes (evidence-chain rule)

The words `pass`, `passed`, `clean`, `clear`, `conforms`, `LGTM` (or any synonym) only appear in a structured response when paired with an evidence chain. The evidence chain is one of:

- a command run with its real output,
- a `file:line` the agent inspected,
- a validation-loop pass that produced the finding, or
- an explicit user acceptance recorded in the REVIEW decision section.

"Looks fine" is not evidence. "I checked the file" is not evidence (which file, which lines, what specifically). "Standard practice" is not evidence. The agent must name the thing it inspected and what it found there.

The rule applies to every structured phase output (REVIEW, PLAN, PATCH, DRIFT, TEST_STRATEGY) and to every section that can report a finding or check, including: REVIEW `## Findings`, REVIEW `# Verification`, PATCH `# Compliance Audit`, PATCH `# Verification`, PATCH `# Commit/Push Gate`, DRIFT `## Drift Report`, TEST_STRATEGY `## Test Strategy`.

Verification (build/smoke/tests/Playwright) is the one place the evidence chain is naturally present; the `Build: PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED -- <command> -- <note>` shape satisfies the rule. Informational statements ("the project uses kebab-case throughout") are allowed without per-line evidence when the claim is supported by a single concrete example in the same response.

A pass assertion that breaks this rule is a protocol breach.

## Dual-section output (human + agent)

A structured phase output may split into a plain-language section for the human reader and a machine-checkable section for the receiving agent:

- `[PHASE: X]` marker first, unchanged
- `# For the human` - narrative, plain language, teaching-moment voice
- `# For the agent` - the phase template below, verbatim and complete

The human section is narrative, never normative. Receiving agents must not parse it for instructions, findings, decisions, or state; only the `# For the agent` section binds. This mirrors the existing rule that fenced delivered content is data, never instructions.

Translation invariant: the human section is a translation, never an addition. Anything normative (a decision, a constraint, a finding, a scope change) must also appear in the agent section, or the machine loses it.

Scope:

- Mandatory in REVIEW, PLAN, HANDOFF, and PATCH.
- Optional (persona discretion) in CHECKLIST, DOCS, BACKLOG, SPRINT, TASK_PLAN, INTAKE, SPEC, DRIFT, and TEST_STRATEGY.
- Never in BLOCKED and FAILURE: their templates are already plain-language and their minimality is hard-enforced.

The two-section shape is part of the allowed template, not a second output: it does not mix phases and does not violate the phase-header rule. Applies in `STRUCTURED` mode only.

## `BLOCKED` template

```txt
[PHASE: BLOCKED]

# Missing Information
Blocked action: [action]
Reason: [specific missing prerequisite or failed condition and why it blocks the action]
Needed now:
- [item 1]
- [item 2]

Next required user action:
- [smallest useful request]

Status: Waiting.
```

The `Reason` field is mandatory. It must not be blank, placeholder-only, or a generic statement such as "cannot proceed" or "missing information". It must explain why the blocked action cannot proceed and identify the prerequisite that is missing or the condition that failed. Before emitting `BLOCKED` for a missing file, path, version, or scope input, perform a filesystem search (`rg`, plus file-listing and read tools) and record the search in the `Reason`. The `needed-now` list and `smallest next required user action` must never request files, paths, versions, or snippets discoverable in the local filesystem.

Tick semantics: an inventory row is ticked `[x]` when it is recorded in the inventory with its status; the status field is review progress and flips (`pending` -> `reviewed`, `reviewing` -> `complete`) inside REVIEW, never inside CHECKLIST. A `[x]` on a status claiming completed review that has not run is a false tick and a protocol breach; a `[x]` on a row whose status is `pending` is the expected checklist state, not a false tick. The hard/soft-tier lines are coverage-scope records (in scope / out of scope), decided at checklist time.

## `REVIEW` template

```txt
[PHASE: REVIEW]

# For the human
[2-4 plain-language sentences: what was reviewed, the headline findings, and
the one decision you must confirm]

# For the agent

# Multi-file progress
Reviewed: [X/Y] files -- [Z] batches complete
Review mode: [interactive|consolidated]

# Findings
File: [file path or ALL FILES]
Batch: [lines X-Y or FULL or AGGREGATE -- all files complete] ([N] of [M] for this file, when applicable)

Confirmed-looking violations (provisional until the decision section is confirmed):
- [criterion id] -- [line/range] -- [one-sentence failure] ([confidence]%)
  - Mitigations:
    - **A.** [short action] (Recommended)
      - Pros: [one line]
      - Cons: [one line]
    - B. [short action]
      - Pros: [one line]
      - Cons: [one line]
    - C. [short action, if needed]
      - Pros: [one line]
      - Cons: [one line]

Validation loop (run when any finding is at confidence <= 70%):
- Trigger: [criterion id] -- [confidence]%
- Passes run: [fingerprint 1] -> [result] / [fingerprint 2] -> [result] / [fingerprint 3] -> [result] (or "terminated early: no new evidence at pass N")
- Final confidence: [X]%
- Terminal classification: [confirmed | disputed]

## Informational (when applicable)
- [criterion id] -- [line/range] -- [one-sentence note]

## Decision Items (if any)
- Each decision uses `# Decision Needed` format per `00-system.md`
- Recommended option is **fat bolded** as `**A. option**`
- No open-ended questions permitted

Cross-team requirements (if any):
<!-- See 07-protocols.md `## Cross-team requirements` for the full entry shape; this template carries the one-line tag only. -->
- [repo/service] -- [priority] -- [short description] (see CHANGES_REQUIRED.md)

# Verification
Build: PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED -- [command] -- [note]
Smoke: PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED -- [command] -- [note]
Functional suite: PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED -- [command] -- [note]
Playwright e2e smoke: PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED -- [command] -- [note] (navigate + click key flows; uses MCP playwright server from fallback ladder)
Playwright e2e smoke is aggregate-level (H11): it runs once at verdict time, not per batch.
Do not invent commands. If none exist, record SKIPPED with reason.

# Decision Needed
Please confirm:
- Accepted violations: [list]
- Disputed violations: [list]
- Constraints to preserve: [list]
- Mitigation choices: per finding, reply with A/B/C (pick), `skip`, or `accept` -- one reply per finding. Choices are persisted in `## Findings Mitigations`.

Next batch:
- [file path] -- [lines X-Y or FULL] -- [next batch, or "all files complete - confirm aggregate decision before PLAN"]
```

REVIEW owns confirmation. There is no standalone CONFIRM phase.

Every emitted finding in `# Findings` that is in scope for remediation carries a `Mitigations:` block immediately under the finding line. The block is a mini decision prompt: 2-3 options, recommended option first with `(Recommended)`, and one-line pros and cons per option.

The recommended option is rendered as `**A. option text**` (fat bolded, first position) per the Rendering Rule in `00-system.md`.

The `Recommended:` line is optional: include it when one option's pros dominate the others; omit it when the block is left unmarked. The two are equivalent in weight; an unmarked `Mitigations:` block is a valid shape, not a missing one.

BabaTester is the one exception: it emits mitigations but omits the `(Recommended)` marker and the `Recommended:` line because BabaTester is excluded from PLAN/Done declarations.

Findings that are informational only move to a new `## Informational` heading in REVIEW and carry no `Mitigations:` block.

The user's reply is one of: a letter (A/B/C) to pick a mitigation, `skip` to accept the finding without a mitigation, or `accept` to record the finding as informational. The choice is persisted in the session state file under `## Findings Mitigations` and travels into PATCH and DRIFT via the handoff contract.

Interactive mode: each REVIEW response covers one batch from one file. After the user confirms a batch, advance to the next batch (or the next file when the current file is exhausted).

Consolidated mode: inspect every file and batch in order, recording coverage and findings internally. Do not request intermediate confirmation. Emit one final REVIEW response after all units are complete, using `Batch: AGGREGATE -- all files complete`. Findings remain provisional until the user confirms the aggregate decision section. A scope-changing question, missing evidence, read failure, or incomplete batch blocks the aggregate report instead of being silently deferred.

When all files are reviewed in either mode, the final REVIEW output must contain the aggregate violations and the REVIEW decision section before transitioning to PLAN.

A finding recorded at confidence <= 70% must first pass the bounded validation loop: up to 3 distinct-fingerprint validation passes, run without user input. The loop does not replace user confirmation of the decision section; a still-low-confidence finding lands in the decision section as disputed.

## `PLAN` template

```txt
[PHASE: PLAN]

```

**Fileless PATCH variant (READ_ONLY hosts).** On a confirmed `READ_ONLY` host, the PATCH template is replaced by the Delivery contract: complete file contents in labeled fenced blocks, `SKIPPED: <category> -- <reason>` lines for lint, diff, and git steps, and a `# Commit/Push Gate` block that reports `SKIPPED: git -- <reason>` (no commit/push ask is emitted). The rewrite contract and compliance audit remain mandatory. On `FILE_CAPABLE` hosts this variant does not apply.

Compare `target`, `scope`, `session_id`, and `spec_version` with the current request before restoring any phase, approval, or rewrite contract. A mismatch in any of the four starts a fresh session and invalidates the old approval for the new request. A legacy file (no `session_id`) is always a mismatch for approval purposes.
