# 04-rubrics

Hard-tier (H1-H12) and soft-tier (S1-S20) review rubrics. Hard-tier items block the PLAN phase until accepted or excluded with justification in the REVIEW decision section. Soft-tier items are quality concerns; flag and discuss, do not hard-block.

## Hard tier (H1-H12) <HIGH_PRIO>

**H1 -- Security: credentials, tokens, secrets in code or logs.** A credential-bearing file (`.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/`, `*.pem`, `*.key`) read with the read tool, or its raw contents in the transcript, is a confirmed H1 breach.

**H2 -- Injection: SQL, command, or template injection vectors.**

**H3 -- Authentication bypass: missing or bypassable auth checks.**

**H4 -- Authorization: missing permission checks on sensitive operations.**

**H5 -- Cryptography: weak algorithms, hardcoded keys, broken IV usage.**

**H6 -- Input validation: missing validation on external inputs.**

**H7 -- Error exposure: stack traces, internal paths, or raw exception details exposed through user-facing responses, client-visible APIs, or other untrusted output.** Trusted internal diagnostic logs and error objects that remain within trusted process boundaries are excluded unless they contain credentials or secrets (H1) or are otherwise mishandled.

**H8 -- Dependency risk: known CVEs or unreviewed dependency versions.**

**H9 -- Data integrity: missing transactions, partial writes, or silent data loss.**

**H10 -- Python type safety (Python only): missing type annotations on function signatures.** Applies to parameters and return type. `Any` requires inline `# pyrefly: ignore` with reason.

**H11 -- Runnable artifact (verdict-gate criterion).** The project must build/compile, start (smoke: boot, or library import/entry-point load), pass the existing functional test suite, and pass a Playwright e2e smoke (navigate to the deployed/preview URL, click through 1-2 critical user flows). Applies once per session/aggregate at verdict time, not per chunk. SKIPPED allowed only with justification recorded in the REVIEW decision section (e.g., no test suite exists, execution environment unavailable, or suite failing on a pre-existing baseline). Do not invent commands. If none exist, record SKIPPED with reason.

**H12 -- Idiom consistency: a change introduces an error-handling or style idiom that conflicts with the dominating pattern of the file or codebase** (e.g., `try/catch` in an exit-code-guard script, Result-wrapping in an exception-style codebase, a new failure idiom for an operation the file already handles). Confirmed when the file's established idiom is evident from uniform usage or an in-code comment. When the imported idiom cannot detect the failure it claims to handle, H9 applies alongside.

**H13 -- No Duplication: fix introduces logic duplicated from an existing utility/helper/validator.** See `rules.md` H13 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when `system_evidence.existing_utilities` contains a utility matching the new code pattern.

**H14 -- Library-First: fix hand-rolls logic that a maintained library already solves.** See `rules.md` H14 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when `system_evidence.available_libraries` contains a library for the problem domain and the hand-rolled code exceeds the threshold.

**H15 -- Ownership Routing: fix bypasses the architectural owner of the concern.** See `rules.md` H15 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when the patch does not call the module identified as `pattern_owner` in `system_evidence`.

**H16 -- Layer Discipline: fix violates architectural layer boundaries.** See `rules.md` H16 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when the target file's layer classification identifies a forbidden pattern in the new code.

**H17 -- No Single-Use Abstraction: fix creates a new function/class/module with <=1 caller.** See `rules.md` H17 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when a new symbol added by the fix has <=1 caller outside its defining file.

**H18 -- Dominant Idiom Enforcement: fix introduces a new pattern when a dominant pattern exists with high confidence.** See `rules.md` H18 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when `system_evidence.dominant_idiom` exists with high confidence and the fix's idiom differs.

**H19 -- No Over-Engineering: fix creates unnecessary abstraction layers.** See `rules.md` H19 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when abstraction layers added > 1 AND callers < 3.

**H20 -- Composition Over Inheritance: fix uses class inheritance when composition is dominant in the layer.** See `rules.md` H20 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when composition usage > 60% in the layer AND fix uses `extends`.

**H21 -- Dependency Injection: fix uses `new` or direct instantiation outside the composition root.** See `rules.md` H21 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when target is not the composition root AND contains `new`.

**H22 -- Single Source of Truth: fix duplicates config/data that exists in a single source.** See `rules.md` H22 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when new code contains literals matching existing config/constant entries.

**H23 -- Early Returns: fix introduces deep nesting (>3 levels) without early returns.** See `rules.md` H23 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when nesting depth > 3 AND no early return exists in the function.

**H24 -- No Unnecessary Abstraction: fix creates a wrapper/adapter/delegator with <=1 caller.** See `rules.md` H24 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when a new wrapper/adapter has <=1 caller.

**H25 -- No Speculative Code: fix includes code for concerns not present in the task scope.** See `rules.md` H25 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when new code contains TODOs without owner, unused parameters, or unreachable branches.

**H26 -- No Manual-Sync Registries: fix creates a registry/mapping that requires manual sync.** See `rules.md` H26 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when registry entries do not match discovered items.

**H27 -- No Over-Engineered Discovery: fix uses dynamic discovery when explicit list is simpler.** See `rules.md` H27 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when explicit list has <10 items AND discovery mechanism is >3 lines.

**H28 -- Code-Decision Ladder Compliance: fix adds new code when existing utility/library/standard lib already solves it.** See `rules.md` H28 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when existing solution with >80% similarity is found.

**H29 -- Stepdown Rule: fix mixes high-level orchestration with low-level operations without named intermediate.** See `rules.md` H29 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. Advisory only.

**H30 -- Newspaper Order: fix places public function below private helper it calls.** See `rules.md` H30 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. Advisory only.

**H31 -- No Flag/Output Arguments: fix introduces boolean flag arguments or mutates output arguments.** See `rules.md` H31 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when new function signature contains boolean flag or output argument pattern.

**H32 -- Law of Demeter: fix introduces train-wreck chains (a.b.c.d) longer than 1 dot.** See `rules.md` H32 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. Advisory only.

**H33 -- No Dead Code: fix adds unreachable code or unused exports.** See `rules.md` H33 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when new code contains unreachable paths or unused exports.

**H34 -- No Magic Values: fix introduces unexplained literals that should be named constants.** See `rules.md` H34 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. Advisory only.

**H35 -- Error Handling Quality: fix swallows exceptions or loses error context.** See `rules.md` H35 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when catch block is empty or lacks context.

**H36 -- Logging Quality: fix adds debug prints or exposes sensitive data in logs.** See `rules.md` H36 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when debug prints or sensitive data patterns are found in new code.

**H37 -- Type Safety (Non-Python): fix uses unsafe casts, `any` type, or `as` without type guard.** See `rules.md` H37 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when `any` or unsafe cast patterns are found in new code.

**H38 -- No Obvious Performance Issues: fix introduces O(n2) scans, nested loops over same data, or synchronous blocking in async context.** See `rules.md` H38 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. Advisory only.

**H39 -- No Multi-Concept Files: fix combines multiple classes, errors, types, interfaces, or schemas into a single file.** See `rules.md` H39 for detection, auto-exception, and scope. System-triggered: fires when a file contains multiple distinct concept types.

## Soft tier (S1-S20)

**S1 -- Naming: unclear, misleading, or inconsistent identifiers.**

**S2 -- Function length: functions exceeding a single clear responsibility.**

**S3 -- Complexity: deeply nested conditionals or loops without justification.**

**S4 -- Duplication: repeated logic that should be extracted.**

**S5 -- Dead code: unreachable or unused code paths.**

**S6 -- Magic values: unexplained literals that should be named constants.**

**S7 -- Error handling: swallowed exceptions or missing error context; includes trusted internal errors that expose unnecessary implementation details.**

**S8 -- Logging: missing, excessive, or misleading log statements; includes unnecessary absolute paths or raw exception details in trusted internal logs.**

**S9 -- Test coverage: missing tests for critical paths.**

**S10 -- Documentation: missing or misleading comments on non-obvious logic.**

**S11 -- Type safety: missing type annotations or unsafe casts.** Note: in Python code, S11 is upgraded to H10 for missing type annotations on function signatures (parameters and return types).

**S12 -- Performance: obvious inefficiencies with measurable impact.**

**S13 -- Over-engineering: unrequested abstractions or speculative genericity beyond what the change needs;** includes an interface with one implementation, a factory for one product, config for values that never change, and new dependencies when an existing one covers the need.

**S14 -- Stepdown rule: a function's body mixes high-level orchestration with low-level operations.** Functions read top-to-bottom and call functions one level of abstraction below them. A function whose first line is a high-level call (`fetchUser()`) and whose next line is a low-level call (`parseJwt(token)`) without a named intermediate is a stepdown violation (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 3 "One Level of Abstraction per Function" / ch. 11 "The Stepdown Rule").

**S15 -- Newspaper order: a file does not read top-to-bottom from public API to private details.** A public function appears below the private helper it calls, or a related group of functions is split across the top and bottom of the file. Files read like a newspaper article: headline first, then increasingly fine detail (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 5 / ch. 11 "The Newspaper Metaphor").

**S16 -- Flag/output arguments: a function takes a boolean flag that selects between two behaviors, or a function mutates an argument passed by reference instead of returning a value.** Split the flag-argument function into two; return a value instead of mutating an output argument (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 3 / ch. 8 "Function Arguments" -- Flag Arguments and Output Arguments).

**S17 -- Tell, don't ask (Law of Demeter): a method reaches through another object to access its parts (`a.b.c.d`); the behavior belongs on the inner object.** A chain of more than one dot is a Demeter violation unless the chain is a fluent-builder return value (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 6 / ch. 12 "Objects and Data Structures" -- The Law of Demeter).

**S18 -- Full Comprehension Read violation: using sliced/partial file reads instead of reading files in full (largest window, offset-chunked when large) before editing, judging, or reviewing.** This includes all related files: callers, importers, dependencies, and transitive dependents. Partial reads reduce accuracy and are prohibited per `00-system.md` `## Identity` `### Rules always in force` (Full Comprehension Read rule). **Exception**: the initial load of all 8 system files at STARTUP MUST read each file in a single read with NO chunking.

**S19 -- Log Output Calls in agent-generated code: debug prints (`console.log`, `print`, `Write-Host`, `printf`, etc.) left in generated or edited code.** These reduce accuracy and pollute the transcript. Evidence must come from `file:line` inspected, command output, validation-loop pass, or explicit user acceptance per `00-system.md` Loop protection / Log output prohibition.

**S20 -- Decision format violation: using open-ended questions (`## Open question for you`, prose question lists) instead of `# Decision Needed` blocks with fat-bolded recommended option as `**A. option text**`.** Every user decision must use the decision format with 2-3 options, recommended option first as bolded A per `00-system.md` Rendering Rule.

**S21 -- Accessibility regression**: a UI change removes semantic HTML, breaks keyboard navigation, removes ARIA labels, or fails color contrast requirements without an a11y review.

**S22 -- Missing a11y test coverage**: a UI component has no a11y test (axe-core, pa11y, lighthouse a11y score) for interactive elements, forms, or modal dialogs.

**S23 -- SEO regression**: a page change removes or breaks meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), canonical URLs, or heading hierarchy without SEO review.

**S24 -- Missing SEO test coverage**: a content page has no SEO validation for meta descriptions, title tags, or structured data.

**S25 -- Missing required-field metadata in templates**: a phase template is missing the required/optional field metadata in the `## Template Field Contract` section, or the metadata does not match the actual template shape.

## Documented extension IDs

When artifact, gitattributes, or pre-commit review is in scope, those extensions fall under the soft-tier coverage tick:

- `S-artifact` -- artifact handling rules (binary files, build outputs, generated content).
- `S-gitattributes` -- `.gitattributes` correctness (line endings, diff drivers, large-file handling).
- `S-precommit` -- pre-commit hook configuration (file globs, hook ordering, auto-fix behavior).

When logical correctness review is in scope, the L-series rubrics apply:

- `L1-L10` -- Logical correctness: mathematical invariants (L1), boundary conditions (L2), state machines (L3), time-series integrity (L4), portfolio arithmetic (L5), statistical validity (L6), backtesting integrity (L7), risk/sizing logic (L8), metric correctness (L9), strategy logic (L10).

Severity:

- **Blocking**: L1-L10 findings that affect correctness, safety, financial outcomes, or data integrity are blocking (behave like H-tier: block PATCH until accepted or excluded with justification in the REVIEW decision section).
- **Advisory**: L-tier findings in non-critical paths (logging, display formatting, non-validated display calculations, cosmetic state transitions) are advisory (behave like S-tier: flag and discuss, do not hard-block).

The reviewer must classify each L-tier finding as blocking or advisory at discovery time.

## Usage

- Apply all hard-tier items to every chunk unless explicitly excluded in the checklist. H11 is the sole aggregate-level criterion; H1-H10 and H12 still apply per chunk.
- Flag all applicable soft-tier items in the REVIEW phase. Soft-tier items are eligible for the PLAN phase only after acceptance in the REVIEW decision section.
- A confirmed hard-tier violation blocks the PLAN phase until accepted or excluded with justification in the REVIEW decision section.
