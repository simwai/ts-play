# 05-impl-style

Implementation style core. Stack variants are inline sections below; pick the one matching the session's active language. Apply these defaults to every PATCH unless the target repo's `STYLE_POLICY.md` artifact or the INTAKE `Stack/Style:` field overrides them.

## General principles

- DRY
- KISS
- Composition over inheritance
- SOLID and CUPID where complexity justifies them
- Dependency injection over hidden construction. Use the stack's mandated DI container. Favor constructor injection; wire the composition root at the application entry point. Default to transient lifetime unless a clear singleton or scoped rationale exists.
- Single source of truth
- Early returns over deep nesting
- Big-O awareness for hot or scalable paths
- Security and type safety are first-class concerns

## Greenfield projects (new projects and new files)

When the target is a new project from scratch, or new files being added to a repo that has no established local conventions (empty or near-empty source tree, no existing style), the defaults in this file ARE the project conventions until the user explicitly overrides them:

- the mandated stacks and helpers (see the per-stack sections)
- the error-handling idiom for the stack
- naming and file-naming rules (kebab-case, snake_case, PascalCase per stack)
- project structure (flat `src/`, split at 8 files, layer names)
- region tags for new projects
- the code-decision ladder, comment policy, and logging palette

This is the one case where "defaults" are binding rather than advisory: a greenfield scaffold has no existing conventions to preserve, so the module defaults fill that role. A deviation from a greenfield default requires explicit user approval recorded in the INTAKE `Stack/Style:` field or the PLAN `Conventions:` field; an agent must never silently substitute its own generic conventions. The "strong defaults, not absolute laws" framing above continues to apply to existing codebases, where the local-convention policy governs.

## Local-convention policy

The decision between _preserve local convention_ and _upgrade to house style_ is a **per-project** choice, made once when the target project adopts the system. There is no per-file override.

- The decision is recorded in the target project's `STYLE_POLICY.md` artifact. Once recorded, the bot **must not** modify that artifact.
- If the artifact is missing or malformed in a target project, the bot runs the auto-trigger ask from `00-system.md` (which recommends `preserve-local` as option A) and proceeds with the result.
- If the user declines the ask or the ask cannot run, the bot defaults to `preserve-local` and emits a one-line note in the plan that the field is unset or invalid, so a human can correct it.
- The bot reads the project-level decision on every PATCH (loads `STYLE_POLICY.md`; the field is a single line in frontmatter). It applies the decision **uniformly across every touched file** in that project.
- When the decision is `upgrade-house-style`: the touched lines are upgraded; the plan's `Conventions:` field names the house-style rules being applied; an upgrade to a touched file is not a reformat of untouched code, only of the lines the change requires. The plan's `## Touched files` block notes any file whose existing style visibly differs from the house style (e.g., a vendored library), without making that file an exception to the policy.
- When the decision is `preserve-local`: the existing "preserve local conventions" rule applies.
- When creating or updating documentation (README, ADR, API docs, changelog, release notes), follow the repository's existing documentation conventions and tone, not only its Markdown lint configuration.
- Before creating a commit, inspect the repository's existing commit-message conventions (Conventional Commits, ticket or scope prefixes, subject length, body style) and follow them. If no convention is established, state the chosen format instead of inventing one silently.

Pass-assertion discipline: see `03-output-and-state.md` global rule. A claim that a local convention "looks fine" or "is consistent" is not evidence; the agent must name the inspected lines or cite the command that produced the conclusion.

## Error-handling idiom consistency (all stacks)

- The error-handling idiom that dominates a file or codebase wins. Before choosing how a new or changed code path reports failure, read the touched file and identify its established idiom: exit-code guards (`$LASTEXITCODE`), Result-style helpers, or exceptions.
- Do not introduce a different idiom for an operation the file already handles. A `try/catch` in an exit-code-guard script, or Result-wrapping in an exception-style codebase, is an idiom-consistency violation [H12].
- A deliberate idiom change requires explicit user approval before it enters a plan; without it, the change is a confirmed hard-tier finding [H12].
- The per-stack sections state preferred helpers, but the dominance rule overrides them when the file's established pattern differs.

## Design heuristics

- Prefer reusable abstractions only when repetition or a real variability axis exists.
- Use YAGNI for hypothetical features.
- Avoid registries or mappings that require manual sync when dynamic discovery is simpler and safer.
- Keep explicit lists when discovery would add needless complexity or reduce clarity.
- Consider one-off versus repeating cost before abstracting.

### Code-decision ladder

Before writing new code, stop at the first rung that holds:

1. Does this need to exist at all? YAGNI; skip speculative features.
2. Already in this codebase? Reuse the helper, util, type, or pattern; look before you write.
3. Does the standard library do it? Use it.
4. Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it (CSS over JS, DB constraint over app code).
5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it; never add a new one for what a few lines can do. The mandated stacks are an explicitly requested project convention; the ladder governs unrequested additions only.
6. Can it be one line? One line.
7. Only then: the minimum code that works.

The ladder runs after full comprehension, never instead of it: read the task and the code it touches, trace the real flow end to end, then climb. Guardrails:

- Never let a rung simplify away input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, or accessibility; those are protected by the hard-tier rubric.
- Bug fix = root cause, not symptom: grep the callers of the function you touch and fix the shared function once; one guard in the shared function is a smaller diff than a guard in every caller.
- The shortest working diff wins, but only once the problem is understood; the smallest change in the wrong place is a second bug, not laziness.

## Stepdown rule (S14)

Functions read top-to-bottom. Each function calls functions one level of abstraction below it. At the design level, this means each function should decompose into one level of abstraction below the function's primary responsibility; the example that follows illustrates this decomposition. A function whose first line is a high-level call (`fetchUser()`) and whose next line is a low-level call (`parseJwt(token)`) without a named intermediate is a stepdown violation. The body of every function should be readable as a single sentence at one level of abstraction; the supporting helpers carry the next level down. (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 3 "One Level of Abstraction per Function" / ch. 11 "The Stepdown Rule".)

## Newspaper order (S15)

A file reads like a newspaper article: headline first, then increasingly fine-grained detail as you scroll. The public API sits at the top, private helpers follow, and the reader never has to scroll up to find a called function. A file that places a public function below the private helper it calls, or splits a related group of functions across the top and bottom, is a newspaper-order violation. (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 5 "The Purpose of Formatting" / ch. 11 "The Newspaper Metaphor".)

## Flag arguments and output arguments (S16)

A boolean flag argument almost always means the function does two things; split it. An output argument (a function that mutates an argument passed by reference) is a hidden side effect; return a value instead. The only acceptable uses are integration with APIs that require a mutable handle (rare) and fluent builders that return `this` (handled by S17's exception). (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 3 / ch. 8 "Function Arguments" - Flag Arguments and Output Arguments.)

## Tell, don't ask - Law of Demeter (S17)

A method should not reach through another object to access its parts. `customer.wallet.balance.currency` exposes the wallet's internals; the behavior belongs on the wallet, called from the customer. Tell the wallet to do something; don't ask the wallet for its balance and decide yourself. A chain of more than one dot is a Demeter violation unless the chain is a fluent-builder return value or a known data-transfer object. (Martin, _Clean Code_ ch. 6 / ch. 12 "Objects and Data Structures".)

## Minimal verification floor

- Non-trivial new logic (a branch, a loop, a parser, a money/security path) leaves one runnable check behind; the smallest thing that fails if the logic breaks: an assert-based self-check or one small test file. No test frameworks, fixtures, or per-function suites unless asked.
- Trivial one-liners need no test; YAGNI applies to tests too.
- This floor never replaces the per-edit lint gate or the project checks; it is the minimum, not the ceiling.

## Project structure

- Start new projects with a flat `src/` directory.
- When any directory exceeds 8 files, split by layer (`controllers/`, `services/`, `repositories/`, `middleware/`, etc.).
- Do not split preemptively.
- Keep configuration and tooling files at the repository root (`tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `opencode.jsonc`, `.markdownlint.jsonc`), not inside `src/`; keep reusable scripts in a root-level `scripts/`.
- Keep tests beside the code they cover using the stack's test suffix, or in a top-level `tests/` mirroring `src/` when the project prefers separation; pick one convention per project.
- Use kebab-case for directory names (`user-profile/`, `api-gateway/`).
- For frontend `src/` splits, use the standard layer names `components/`, `composables/` (or `hooks/`), `stores/`, `views/`, and `utils/`; do not create a directory for a single file.

## Comments

_Reference: Robert C. Martin, Clean Code -- chapter 4 (1st ed., 2008) / chapter 5 (2nd ed., 2025). The categories below are Martin's, with stack-specific markers added on top._

**Content over prefix.** The rule is what the comment says, not what character starts it. Prefix follows the language (`//` in TS/JS/Java/Pine, `#` in Python/PowerShell/Bash, `--` in SQL/Lua/Haskell -- automatic, not policed here). Stack sections do not re-state the prefix; this is the only place the prefix is mentioned.

**Why, not what.** Never restate the next line of code. Never write `// increment counter` above `i++`. Comments that fail this rule are an S10 finding at review time and a per-edit-lint-gate failure at patch time.

**Good comments - categories that earn a comment (Martin ch. 4 / ch. 5):**

- **Legal comments** -- copyright, license, or authorship headers required by a contract. Place once at the top of the file; never duplicate.
- **Informative comments** -- provide basic information that the language cannot express (e.g., the regex pattern's meaning, the byte order of a packed struct). Prefer a named constant over a comment when the constant carries the same information.
- **Explanation of intent** -- why a block of code exists, not what it does. The agent must answer "what would the next reader re-derive without this comment?" in one sentence. Write as a plain sentence, no marker prefix.
- **Clarification** -- translate an obscure argument or return value into something readable. Use only when the alternative is worse than the comment (e.g., a standard-library call whose return value is genuinely confusing).
- **Warning of consequences** -- flag a non-obvious failure mode the caller would otherwise miss. Write as a plain sentence, no marker prefix.
- **TODO comments** -- actions the author intends to take later, with an owner and a target. Format: `// TODO(<owner>): <what> -- <why deferred>`. A TODO without an owner is disallowed by default.
- **Amplification** -- make an otherwise subtle line of code louder. Use sparingly; if the code needs amplification, refactor it first.
- **Public-API docstrings** -- public-API docstrings are required for any function, class, or module that crosses a package or service boundary. Private/internal code does not get a docstring; the name carries the meaning.

**Bad comments - categories that violate this rule (Martin ch. 4 / ch. 5):**

- **Redundant or duplicative** -- restates the next line of code in prose, or says exactly what the code already expresses (e.g., `// set user to null` above `user = null`). The code is the source of truth. Always delete.
- **Misleading or wrong** -- says one thing while the code does another. Worse than no comment. Delete and fix the code or the comment.
- **Noise or formatting abuse** -- restates the obvious in a noisy way, uses loud markers (`////////////////////////////////////////////`), ASCII art separators, `// ==== Section ====`, `// ----- HEYO -----`, or `// some random label` headers. Use `// #region LABEL` / `// #endregion` instead. Region tags are the only sanctioned way to mark a section.
- **Process artifacts** -- change logs at file top ("added by X on Y"), attributions (`// Added by Simon`), mandated comments required by process not code ("this function exists"), journal comments. Use git, not comments.
- **Dead or commented-out code** -- dead code left as a comment, commented-out code blocks. Delete; git has the history.
- **Structural violations** -- function headers (block comment at top of every function), docstrings on private/internal code, closing-brace comments (`// } end of while`), position markers (`// ACTIONS` at arbitrary columns). Use section breaks, extract-method, or region tags.
- **Nonlocal or excessive context** -- references system-wide context without a link ("corresponds to issue #1234"), multi-paragraph essays, HTML/markup in comments (`// <b>important</b>`, Markdown/reST markup). Plain prose only; cite URLs inline. Exception: documentation generation libraries explicitly configured in the project.
- **TODO without owner** -- `// TODO: fix this` with no owner and no target. Disallowed by default; explicit user approval in the plan is required to use. Format: `// TODO(<owner>): <what> -- <why deferred>`.

Deliberate simplifications that cut a real corner with a known ceiling (global lock, O(n^2) scan, naive heuristic) are marked with a `simplify:` comment naming the ceiling and the upgrade path, e.g. `# simplify: global lock -- per-account locks if throughput matters`.

## Markdown defaults

- When creating or updating `.md` files, follow the repository's Markdown style and any existing markdownlint configuration, such as `.markdownlint.jsonc`.
- Run the repository's configured Markdown linter for changed Markdown files when available. Do not invent a lint command when no project check exists.
- Do not disable Markdown rules inline or in configuration unless the exception is explicitly required and documented.

## Region tags

- Use `// #region LABEL` / `// #endregion` (or language-equivalent syntax) to group related code in greenfield projects. Region tags are also added to an existing file when the project-level style decision is `upgrade-house-style`.
- Do not add region tags to existing codebases whose project decision is `preserve-local`, unless the file already uses them.
- Labels should be short, descriptive Title Case, e.g. `// #region Database Layer`.

## Naming

Names must reveal intent, usage, and role. Reference: Robert C. Martin, _Clean Code_ chapter 2 (1st ed., 2008) / chapter 4 (2nd ed., 2025) -- "Meaningful Names." Apply the rules there as the house style. The project-specific markers that follow are how this system names the same ideas: classes are nouns (`UserService`); functions are verbs (`calculateTotal`); booleans read like facts (`isAdmin`, `hasPermission`, `canRetry`); in TypeScript class code, prefer underscore-prefixed private fields as a default house style.

## File naming

- Name every file after its primary concept or export; a file exporting several unrelated helpers should split.
- Default to kebab-case filenames unless the stack section says otherwise: `user-service.ts`, `pre-commit-config.yaml`, `architecture.md`. This matches this repository's own system and doc naming.
- TypeScript / JavaScript: kebab-case for **all** files - modules, hooks, components, utilities, and tests (`user-service.ts`, `use-user-profile.ts`, `user-profile.tsx`, `user-repository.ts`, `user-service.test.ts`). PascalCase governs identifiers inside a file (the exported component/class name), not the filename.
- Python: snake*case modules per PEP 8 (`user_service.py`); tests use the `test*` prefix (`test_user_service.py`).
- Java: PascalCase class files matching the public class name per Google Java Style (`UserService.java`); tests use `*Test.java` / `*IT.java`.
- Frontend: kebab-case filenames for components and everything else (Vue SFCs `user-profile.vue`, React `user-profile.tsx`, assets, composables/hooks, tests); the component is identified by its exported PascalCase identifier, not the filename.
- Avoid file names that differ only by case (`user-service.ts` vs `UserService.ts`); they collide on case-insensitive filesystems and break cross-platform checkouts.
- Keep extensions explicit in filenames and imports; extensionless filenames are reserved for executable scripts.

## Security defaults

- Sanitize untrusted input and output where relevant.
- Use parameterized queries / prepared statements for data access.
- Prefer explicit validation at boundaries.

## Logging defaults

- Use semantic color mapping: **red family** (error/fatal), **yellow/orange** (warn), **blue/green** (info/success), **gray/dim** (debug/trace).
- Avoid pairing red and green as the only distinction (colorblind accessibility).
- Prefer 16-color ANSI (bright variants) over 8-color for terminal contrast.
- Use 256-color or true-color only when the logger and terminal both support it.
- House palettes are Catppuccin Mocha and Dracula. Prefer Mocha unless the project already uses Dracula.

### Catppuccin Mocha

| Level | Color               | Hex               | ANSI 256  |
| ----- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| ERROR | Red                 | #f38ba8           | 203       |
| WARN  | Peach / Yellow      | #fab387 / #f9e2af | 215 / 221 |
| INFO  | Sapphire / Blue     | #74c7ec / #89b4fa | 81 / 110  |
| DEBUG | Lavender            | #b4befe           | 183       |
| TRACE | Overlay1 / Surface2 | #7f849c / #585b70 | 102 / 59  |

### Dracula

| Level | Color           | Hex               | ANSI 256  |
| ----- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| ERROR | Red             | #ff5555           | 203       |
| WARN  | Orange / Yellow | #ffb86c / #f1fa8c | 215 / 221 |
| INFO  | Cyan / Green    | #8be9fd / #50fa7b | 81 / 119  |
| DEBUG | Purple          | #bd93f9           | 141       |
| TRACE | Comment (dim)   | #6272a4           | 60        |

- Logging still follows H1 (no secrets), H7 (no untrusted stack traces or internal paths), and S8 (no missing, excessive, or misleading statements).

## Command-line and workflow defaults

- Suggest PowerShell commands first when the project is Windows-centric; invoke in this order: `pwsh` 7.6 first, then Windows PowerShell 5.1, then `cmd`, then `bash`. Default to `pwsh` 7.6 unless the project is pinned to Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Use `rg` (ripgrep) for content search.
- Use regex for multi-file replacements when appropriate.
- Do not generate files or execute commands unless explicitly asked, except during PATCH verification and the per-edit lint gate, where running project checks (lint, typecheck, tests) is required.

## Testing coordination

- If BabaTester provides binding test evidence, treat it as part of the implementation contract.
- If BabaTester provides strong hints, usually honor or adapt them with rationale.
- If BabaTester provides weak hints, defer them explicitly rather than silently dropping them.
- Only output test ideas as a simple should-list unless the user explicitly asks for test code or BabaTester already owns the test-authoring handoff.

## Style floor

The defaults above are a floor, not a ceiling. They never replace the per-edit lint gate or the project checks; they are the minimum, not the maximum. The project style policy in `STYLE_POLICY.md` (`preserve-local` or `upgrade-house-style`) controls how the floor interacts with the file's existing style.

## Stack: TypeScript / JavaScript

- Strict mode: `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`. `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
- `any` is forbidden; use `unknown` and narrow.
- `as` casts require a follow-up type guard or `// @ts-expect-error: <reason>` (binding) with a one-line reason.
- `null` vs `undefined`: prefer `undefined` for "not set" and `null` only when an API contract demands it.
- Async: `async/await` over `.then` chains; `Promise.all` for independent work; never fire-and-forget without a documented reason.
- Errors: typed error subclasses or discriminated unions; `try/catch` only around the failing call, not around the whole function; never `catch (e) {}`.
- Imports: `import { foo } from './foo'` over `import * as foo from './foo'`. `import type { Foo } from './foo'` for types.
- Exports: named exports over default exports except where the framework requires a default (React components, route handlers).
- React (when in scope): function components over class components; hooks at the top level, never in conditionals; props typed via interface or `type`; `useEffect` cleanup function for every subscription; no inline object/array literals in dependency arrays.
- Node (when in scope): `node:` prefix on built-in imports (`node:fs`, `node:path`); ESM by default; `process.exit` only at the top of the entry point.
- Prefer `for...of` over `forEach` for control-flow clarity.
- Avoid `reduce` by default; use it only if it is genuinely clearer than an explicit accumulator.
- Avoid awaiting inside loops unless sequential behavior is required.
- Use type guards when they materially improve safety or readability.
- Do not use unsafe assertions to silence the type system.
- For Node code, assume Node 20 and TS 5.x unless the project states otherwise.
- For the TypeScript ORM, prefer **TypeORM** using Repository pattern only (no Active Record). Decorator-style entity definition is the single enforced style. MikroORM is acknowledged as more type-safe and robust but production experience shows TypeORM makes fewer real-world problems for this team.
- DI container: **tsyringe**. Favor constructor injection; wire the composition root at the application entry point. Default to transient lifetime unless a clear singleton or scoped rationale exists.
- For error handling, prefer **super-result** (`simwai/super-result`) for Result-style explicit flows.
  - **Style: caller-handled, no chaining.** Use `if (result.ok)` / `if (result.err)` type narrowing.
  - First choice: wrap one potentially throwing function call with the established Result helper: `result = from(() => riskyOp())`; no statement blocks inside the factory.
  - A `try/catch` whose only purpose is to convert one function call's thrown error into `err(...)` is always a code smell. Prefer the Result helper instead.
  - Use `try/catch` only when the catch block has additional responsibilities that the Result helper cannot express clearly, such as handling multiple operations, branching on the exception, or performing required cleanup.
  - Do not use `.map()`, `.andThen()`, `.match()`, `.unwrapOr()` or other chaining methods on results.
- If `neverthrow` is already established in the codebase, continue using it; do not mix both.

## Stack: Python

- Write Pythonic, readable code with PEP 8 style.
- Assume Python 3.12 unless the project states otherwise.
- Type annotations on every function signature: parameters and return type. `Any` requires inline `# pyrefly: ignore` comment with a written reason.
- Modern type syntax: `list[int]`, `dict[str, int]`, `X | None` over `Optional[X]`, `from __future__ import annotations` only when needed for forward refs.
- New data classes default to `@dataclass(slots=True)` from `dataclasses`. Use `slots=False` only when inheritance conflicts (document why).
- Naming: snake_case for functions/variables/modules, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Imports: `from x import y` style; `__init__.py` re-exports; no wildcard imports.
- Errors: raise specific exceptions; chain with `raise NewError(...) from original`; never bare `except:` or `except Exception:` without re-raise.
- Tests: pytest with `arrange-act-assert`; fixtures for setup; parametrize for input variation; no test interdependence.
- Async: `asyncio` over thread pools; `async def` only when I/O-bound and the codebase is async; never mix sync and async in the same call chain.
- Package management: tooling detection first in an existing project. In an existing Python project, detect the active toolchain from marker files before running any install/add/lint/test command and route every Python command through it:
  - `pdm` - `pdm.lock`, `[tool.pdm]` in `pyproject.toml`, or `.pdm-python` present: use `pdm install`, `pdm add`, `pdm run <cmd>`.
  - `poetry` - `poetry.lock` or `[tool.poetry]` in `pyproject.toml`: use `poetry install`, `poetry add`, `poetry run <cmd>`.
  - `uv` - `uv.lock` or `[tool.uv]` in `pyproject.toml`: use `uv sync`, `uv add`, `uv run <cmd>`.
  - bare venv - `.venv/`, `venv/`, or `env/` containing an interpreter: invoke that interpreter directly (`<venv>\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows, `<venv>/bin/python` elsewhere) instead of the system Python.
  - Precedence when multiple apply: a configured tool (lockfile or tool table) wins over a bare venv; between tools, `pdm` > `poetry` > `uv`.
  - Never mix tools in one project (no `pip install` beside poetry/uv/pdm, no `uv add` in a pdm project) and never fall back to the system interpreter while a detected environment exists.
- Greenfield default remains `pdm`. New projects use `pyproject.toml` exclusively (no `setup.py`/`setup.cfg`), virtualenv mode enabled, lockfile (`pdm.lock`) committed.
- PDM scripts defined under `[tool.pdm.scripts]`:
  - `lint` - `ruff check src`
  - `format` - `ruff format src`
  - `typecheck` - `pyrefly check` (only if pyrefly is a declared dependency in `pyproject.toml`)
  - `test` - `pytest`
  - `dev` - `python -m src.index`
- Checks run through the detected runner regardless of tool: `lint` (`ruff check src`), `format` (`ruff format src`), `typecheck` (`pyrefly check` — **only if pyrefly is a declared dependency** in `pyproject.toml` under `[project].dependencies` or `[project].optional-dependencies`), `test` (`pytest`) - e.g., `pdm run test`, `poetry run pytest`, `uv run pytest`, or `<venv>\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest` for a bare venv.
- Tool role split (Pylance / Pyrefly / Ruff) so the three tools do not duplicate work or fight each other in the editor or CI:
  - **Pylance** is the language server / IntelliSense. Configure in the target repo's `.vscode/settings.json`: `python.languageServer: "Pylance"`, `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode: "strict"`. Do not enable Pylance's own type checker when Pyrefly is in use; Pyrefly is the single source of type errors.
  - **Pyrefly** is the type checker. Configure in `pyproject.toml [tool.pyrefly]`; CLI entry point is `pyrefly check`. **Only runs if pyrefly is a declared dependency** in `pyproject.toml` under `[project].dependencies` or `[project].optional-dependencies`. Run on save in the editor; full check in CI and pre-commit (when present).
  - **Ruff** is the lint + format + isort tool (single binary replaces flake8, black, and isort). Configure in `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]` and `[tool.ruff.lint]` with a sensible default like `select = ["E", "F", "I", "W", "B", "UP"]`. Editor: `charliermarsh.ruff` extension, `[python].editor.defaultFormatter = "charliermarsh.ruff"`, `formatOnSave = true`, `editor.codeActionsOnSave.source.organizeImports = "explicit"` so Ruff handles isort without a separate extension.
  - **Recommended `.vscode/extensions.json`** `recommendations`: `ms-python.vscode-pylance`, `meta.pyrefly`, `charliermarsh.ruff`. The prompt system does not ship `.vscode/` files; PATCH runs apply this wiring to target repos on demand.
- Pyrefly is the type checker (not Pyright or mypy). Configured in `[tool.pyrefly]` in `pyproject.toml` with `strict = true`. Override noisy strict rules only with rationale. Per-file opt-out via `# pyrefly: ignore[rule]` with a one-line why comment. **Type-check gate only executes when pyrefly is a declared dependency.**
- DI container: **dependency-injector**. Favor constructor injection; wire the composition root at the application entry point. Default to transient lifetime unless a clear singleton or scoped rationale exists.
- Result pattern library: **rustico** with the `safe()` convention:
  - A project-level `safe()` helper wraps a throwing expression into a `Result`:

    ```python
    from rustico import Ok, Err, Result
    from typing import Callable, TypeVar

    T = TypeVar("T")

    def safe(fn: Callable[[], T]) -> Result[T, Exception]:
        try:
            return Ok(fn())
        except Exception as e:
            return Err(e)
    ```

  - Usage: `result = safe(lambda: risky_op())` wraps a single expression.
  - Caller narrows with `if result.is_ok()` / `elif result.is_err()` or `match/case`.
  - **No `.map()`, `.and_then()`, `.or_else()`, `.inspect()`, `.match()` method chaining allowed.**
  - `.unwrap()` / `.unwrap_or()` only at boundary points where exiting the Result pattern into exception land.
  - Do not mix `rustico` with another result library in the same project.

- Preferred typed library stack (fully typed, reduce manual code):
  - Validation/models: **Pydantic v2** for API boundaries; `@dataclass(slots=True)` for internal data.
  - HTTP: **httpx** (fully typed, async).
  - CLI: **typer** (typed via annotation inference).
  - ORM: **SQLAlchemy 2.0** with `Mapped[]` syntax.
  - Lint/format: **ruff** (single binary, replaces flake8/black/isort).
  - Testing: **pytest** + **pytest-asyncio**.
  - Prefer libs that ship `py.typed` marker or have typeshed stubs over untyped alternatives.
- Linting: `ruff` (lint + format) or `black + isort + flake8`; pre-commit hooks run them on save.

## Stack: Java

- Write idiomatic Java following the Google Java Style Guide.
- Java 21 LTS minimum; records and sealed classes for value types and restricted hierarchies.
- Use Spotless with `googleJavaFormat()` to enforce formatting automatically.
- Prefer constructor injection via Dagger/Hilt over field injection.
- Prefer immutable objects; mark fields `final` by default.
- Naming: PascalCase for classes/interfaces, camelCase for methods/fields, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Imports: no wildcard imports; explicit imports only.
- Errors: typed exceptions; checked exceptions for recoverable conditions, unchecked for programming errors; never swallow.
- Streams: `stream()` for transformations, but a `for` loop is fine for side effects; no nested streams (S3).
- Tests: JUnit 5; `@DisplayName` for human-readable test names; one assertion focus per test.
- Build: Maven or Gradle; wrapper committed; lockfile equivalent (`maven.lock` or `gradle.lockfile`) for reproducible builds.
- Linting: Spotless or Checkstyle; pre-commit hook runs it on save.

## Stack: Frontend (Vue / Svelte / general)

- Use semantic HTML5.
- Prefer utility-first class naming in kebab-case.
- Prefer flexbox and nested flex layouts; use grid when it is clearly the simpler layout tool.
- Prefer gap and padding over margin for layout spacing.
- For interactive elements in app UIs, prefer stable `data-testid` values in kebab-case when the project uses Playwright or similar tooling.
- Vue 3 composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`; props typed via `defineProps<{ ... }>()`; emits typed via `defineEmits<{ ... }>()`.
- Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`); props typed via `let { x }: { x: number } = $props()`.
- CSS: scoped styles; CSS custom properties for theming; no inline styles except for dynamic values.
- State: Pinia (Vue) or stores (Svelte); never component-to-component mutation through props drilling more than one level.
- Accessibility: ARIA only when semantic HTML cannot express the relationship; keyboard navigation for every interactive element; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.

## Stack: PowerShell

- Runtime: pwsh 7.6. Never author for Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Approved verbs (`Get-`, `Set-`, `New-`, `Remove-`, `Test-`, `Start-`, `Stop-`); `Update-` only when no approved verb fits and the deviation is documented.
- Cmdlet naming: singular noun, not plural; parameter names hyphenated (`-Path`, not `-FilePath`).
- Error handling: `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` at the top of scripts; `try/catch/finally`; never silently `continue` on a non-zero exit code.
- Native commands (git, robocopy, rg) report failure through `$LASTEXITCODE`, not exceptions: by default a non-zero exit code sets `$?` to `$false` but does not generate an error and does not trigger `catch`/`trap`.
- pwsh 7.3 (experimental) / 7.4 (stable) adds `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference`, default `$false`. With `$true` and `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'`, a non-zero exit code becomes a catchable script-terminating error (`NativeCommandExitException`). Whether `try/catch` fires around a native call is configuration-dependent; check both variables before relying on it; never assume.
- Prefer guard-and-return: run the command, check `$LASTEXITCODE`, write a warning, return. It is version-proof and setting-proof, and matches the dominating idiom of this repo's scripts (see the comment in `sync.ps1` `Update-GitTarget`).
- Beware informational exit codes: robocopy uses 1-7 for success outcomes; test `-ge 8` as `sync.ps1` does.
- Use `try/catch/finally` for cmdlet terminating errors and for cleanup that must run when a terminating error occurs (`finally` always runs). Under guard-and-return, restore env-var guards immediately after the guarded call; no `finally` is needed because nothing throws on that path.
- Since pwsh 7.2, `2>&1`-redirected native stderr is no longer affected by `$ErrorActionPreference`; the 5.1-era "stderr becomes terminating under Stop" hazard does not apply to pwsh.
- Output: `Write-Host` for user-facing messages, `Write-Output` (or implicit) for pipeline data, `Write-Verbose` for diagnostics. Never `Write-Host` for data the caller needs to consume.
- Modules: `Export-ModuleMember` for explicit public surface; `using module` (not `Import-Module` inline) when the module is a class library.
- Tests: Pester with `Describe`/`Context`/`It`; `Should -Be` / `Should -Throw` / `Should -Invoke`; mock with `Mock`.

## Stack: Pine Script

- Pine v6 or later; `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration at the top of the script.
- Target Pine Script v5+ (`//@version=5` or newer); keep the version directive on line 1.
- Write every statement on a single physical line.
- Never break a line inside a ternary chain (`a ? b : c`) or inside a function call's argument list (`plot(`, `request.security(`, `label.new(`, ...) - Pine's continuation rules are fragile at those break points and produce `end of line without line continuation` compile errors.
- Break lines only where Pine requires them: indented block bodies for `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and user-defined functions (Pine is indentation-scoped like Python; use 4 spaces consistently, never mix tabs and spaces).
- When a single line grows unwieldy, refactor instead of wrapping: extract intermediate variables, or replace a long ternary with an `if`/`else` block.
- Put comments on their own line above the statement; never end a line that continues onto the next line with a `//` comment (the compiler rejects it).
- Existing multi-line Pine code keeps its local convention unless reformatting is explicitly approved.
- Naming: PascalCase for functions and types, camelCase for variables, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Inputs: `input.int`, `input.float`, `input.bool`, `input.string`, `input.color`, `input.timeframe` with explicit `title=` and `tooltip=`.
- Plots: `plot` only after `indicator()`; `plotshape` for markers; `bgcolor` for context bands.
- Errors: `runtime.error()` for unrecoverable conditions; `assert` only for invariant checks; never swallow `runtime.error`.
- Performance: no `for` loops over `bar_index` ranges; use built-in functions (`ta.crossover`, `ta.highest`) for O(1) equivalents.
- Testing: TradingView's built-in strategy tester for backtests; manual visual inspection for indicator behavior.

## Stack: Database

- Schema design: 3NF minimum, denormalize only with documented reason; every foreign key has a matching index.
- Target: 3NF normalization. Every table has a single-column `INTEGER` primary key named `id`. Denormalization requires explicit rationale.
- Table names are singular `snake_case`. Foreign keys are `[singular_table]_id`. Indexes named `idx_[table]_[columns]`. No prefixes or suffixes.
- Naming: snake_case for tables and columns; plural table names (`users`, not `user`); singular column names for scalar fields.
- Type subset (cross-database compatible): `INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `BOOLEAN`, `REAL`. No `SERIAL`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`, `TINYINT`, `NUMERIC`, or `DECIMAL`. Use `TEXT` with `CHECK (length(col) <= n)` for varchar semantics.
- Timestamps are `TEXT` storing Unix epoch seconds as strings. Named `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`.
- Every column explicit `NOT NULL` or nullable. `BOOLEAN` columns must be `NOT NULL DEFAULT false`.
- Migrations: forward-only, one change per migration, named with timestamp + description; never edit a migration after it has been applied.
- Indexes: every foreign key, every column referenced in `WHERE` for non-trivial queries, every column used in `ORDER BY` for sort. Every foreign key must have an explicit index. Add indexes for `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY` columns on tables over ~1k rows.
- Queries: parameterized only; no string concatenation; `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reviewed for queries over 100ms.
- Transactions: every multi-statement write wraps in a transaction; isolation level chosen explicitly, not defaulted. Neither SQLite nor Postgres supports unsigned integers natively - use `CHECK (col >= 0)` for non-negative constraints.
